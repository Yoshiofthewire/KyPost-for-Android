# Pairing Auth Headers (Android) Progress Ledger

**Plan:** docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-19-pairing-auth-headers-android.md
**Base commit:** 3f04899 (includes the plan-doc commit itself)
**Start date:** 2026-07-19

## Tasks

- [x] Task 1: Shared `pairingAuthHeaders()` extension helper
- [x] Task 2: `RelayMailSource.kt`
- [x] Task 3: `ContactSyncClient.kt`
- [ ] Task 4: `GroupsSyncClient.kt`
- [ ] Task 5: `PullNotificationClient.kt`
- [ ] Task 6: `PgpQrClient.kt`

## Notes

- Prior ledger content (contact-sync-intro-popup plan, already merged) removed
  here — preserved in git history (`git log -p -- .superpowers/sdd/progress.md`)
  if needed again.
- Worktree created via `EnterWorktree` (branch
  `worktree-pairing-auth-headers-android`, based on local `main`).
- `app/google-services.json` is gitignored and wasn't present in the fresh
  worktree; copied over manually from the primary checkout before running
  the baseline build (same as noted in the prior plan's ledger).
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-19-pairing-auth-headers-android.md` was
  untracked in the primary checkout (written during planning, not yet
  committed) and so wasn't present in the fresh worktree either; copied over
  and committed as this branch's first commit (`3f04899`).
- Baseline `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` passed clean before Task 1 was
  dispatched.

## Completed

- Task 1: complete (commits 67022f4..3d71f8f, review clean, no findings).
- Task 2: complete (commits 3d71f8f..dbc784d, review clean — all 10 call sites individually verified by reviewer, no findings).
- Task 3: complete (commits 540d197..9b7fec5, review clean).
  Minor (deferred to final review): import ordering in ContactSyncClientTest.kt
  (HEADER_SUBSCRIBER_ID before HEADER_SUBSCRIBER_HASH, not alphabetical) — cosmetic.
